🎰 Python Slot Machine Game
A fully interactive command‑line slot machine game built in Python. This project simulates a classic 3×3 slot machine where players can deposit money, place bets across multiple lines, spin the reels, and win based on symbol probabilities and payout values. It’s designed to demonstrate clean logic, modular functions, user input validation, and randomized game mechanics.

🚀 Features
- Deposit system to manage player balance
- Configurable betting across 1–3 lines
- Randomized slot machine spins based on weighted symbol distribution
- Automatic winnings calculation using symbol values
- Clear, user‑friendly CLI interface
- Modular, well‑commented code suitable for learning and portfolio use

🧠 How It Works
- The player deposits money to start.
- They choose how many lines to bet on and how much to bet per line.
- The slot machine generates a random 3×3 grid using weighted symbols.
- If all symbols match on a bet line, the player wins based on the symbol’s payout value.
- The game continues until the player chooses to quit.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built‑in modules (random)
- Clean, modular function design

📂 Project Structure
slot_machine.py


All game logic is contained in a single, well‑organized Python file with detailed comments explaining each block of code.

🎯 Purpose
This project was created to strengthen Python fundamentals, practice clean code structure, and build a fun, interactive program suitable for showcasing in a professional portfolio.
